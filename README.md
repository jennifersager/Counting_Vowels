# Counting_Vowels
This is a program that counts the number of vowels (and three extra letters) in a file. The program can be run from a console window by passing arguments through the command line.
This is my first program that uses the command line. 
I wrote this for a school assignment. I counted all of the vowels in the U.S. Constitution.
