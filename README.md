# Counting_Vowels
This is a program that counts the number of vowels (and three extra letters) in a file. The program can be run from a console window by passing arguments through the command line.
This is my first program that uses the command line. 
I wrote this for a school assignment. I counted all of the vowels in the U.S. Constitution.
Main() takes in arguments. The program checks to make sure arguments are given and that a file name is one of them. The program opens the file, uses a while loop to read each line, and uses a switch statement to check for each vowel.
